# 🌟 React JS Roadmap

## 🔍 Why Learn React?
- It's **popular** (hype, job opportunities, trend).
- Helps build **modern UIs** easily.
- Makes it easier to manage and build **complex frontends**.

## ⏳ When Should You Learn React?
- **After mastering JavaScript** and understanding the **DOM**.
- Avoid using it for small projects in the **initial phase**.

## 🛠️ Why React Was Created?
- To solve **phantom/ghost UI issues** (inconsistencies between UI and logic).
- The core issue: **State (JS) & UI (DOM) were not in sync**.

### First Adopters
- **Khan Academy**
- **Unsplash**

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Founding Members of React

## 🧠 React Learning Process: Two Pedagogies

### 🧪 Pedagogy 1: Deep Dive
- Learn the internals:
  - **Babel**
  - **Fiber architecture**
  - **Virtual DOM**
  - **Diffing algorithm**
  - **Hydration**

### 🛠️ Pedagogy 2: Learn by Building
- Create projects, one topic at a time:
  - **Todo App**
  - **Calculator**
  - **GitHub API project**

---

## 🏗️ React: Library vs Framework
- React is a **library** (focused on UI).
- Unlike **frameworks**, React doesn't include built-in routing or state management.

---

## 📚 Topics to Learn

### 🧩 Core React Concepts
- JSX
- **State** (UI manipulation)
- **Component reusability**
- **Props** (passing data)
- **Hooks** (propagate & manage state changes)

### 🔄 Add-ons to React
- **Routing** (React doesn't include routing)
  - Use: `react-router-dom`
- **State Management**
  - `Redux`, `Redux Toolkit`, `Zustand`, `Context API`
- **Class-based Components** (for working with legacy code)

## 🚀 BAAS (Backend as a Service) Apps
- Ideal for building:
  - Social media clones
  - E-commerce apps

### Popular BAAS Tools
- **Firebase**
- **Appwrite**
- **Supabase**

---

## 🧑‍🎓 Free/Open Source Resources
- [`freeApi.app`](https://freeapi.app)

## 📈 After React
- React is **not a complete solution**:
  - No SEO
  - No built-in routing
  - Client-side rendering only

### Recommended Frameworks:
- **Next.js**
- **Gatsby**
- **Remix**

You can also consider learning **backend development** next.
