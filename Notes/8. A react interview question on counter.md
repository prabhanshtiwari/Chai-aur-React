# React Interview Concept: State Batching and Asynchronous Updates

---

## 🔥 **Core Concept: React State Updates are Asynchronous and Batched**

---

### 🚨 **Scenario:**

In a React component, you have a counter state:

```jsx
const [counter, setCounter] = useState(15);
```

You then call the state updater multiple times like this:

```jsx
setCounter(counter + 1);
setCounter(counter + 1);
setCounter(counter + 1);
setCounter(counter + 1);
setCounter(counter + 1);
```

---

### ❓ **What do you think the final value will be?**

Logically, you might expect:

```
15 → 16 → 17 → 18 → 19 → 20
```

But that's **not** what happens!

---

### ❌ **Incorrect Assumption:**

React batches these state updates and reads the **same old `counter` value** (which is `15`) for all 5 updates. So:

```jsx
setCounter(counter + 1); // counter is 15 → sets 16
setCounter(counter + 1); // counter is still 15 → sets 16 again
...
```

Every update is working with the same stale value `15`.

➡️ **Final value: `16` only**, not `20`.

---

### ✅ **The Right Way: Functional Updates**

If your next state depends on the **previous state**, React recommends using the **functional update** syntax:

```jsx
setCounter(prevCounter => prevCounter + 1);
```

If you call this five times:

```jsx
setCounter(prev => prev + 1);
setCounter(prev => prev + 1);
setCounter(prev => prev + 1);
setCounter(prev => prev + 1);
setCounter(prev => prev + 1);
```

Now React uses the **latest value each time** for the update.

➡️ **Final result: `15 → 20 ✅`**

---

## 🤔 **Why is this Important?**

* This is a **frequently asked React interview question**.
* It affects **performance optimization** and proper state management.
* It’s deeply connected to **React’s Fiber architecture** and **state batching mechanism**.

## 🔄 **Bonus Analogy (Super Simple Explanation):**

> Imagine you told 5 friends one after another:
> "Write my name on the *next* number after 15."
> But they all saw the board **at the same time**, so they all saw **15** and wrote **16**.

> But if you said:
> "Write your name on the next number **after what the previous person wrote**,"
> Then each person sees the latest update and adds 1 → reaching 20 in the end.

## 📌 **TL;DR Summary Table**

| Code                              | Final Counter Value |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| 5x `setCounter(counter + 1)`      | ❌ `16`              |
| 5x `setCounter(prev => prev + 1)` | ✅ `20`              |
