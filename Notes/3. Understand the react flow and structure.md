# 📁 React Folder Structure & Project Overview

### Basic React Project:

You can create a React project using tools like:

* **Create React App (CRA)**
* **Vite**
* **Parcel**
* Others...

These tools help you **set up a React environment quickly**, bundling all configurations for you (Webpack, Babel, etc.).

---

## 🆚 CRA vs Vite – Folder Structure & Setup

### 1. 📦 `node_modules`

* Contains all **dependencies** installed via `npm install` or `yarn install`.
* It's **auto-generated**, and we don’t touch this folder manually.
* Every package listed in `package.json` gets installed here.

---

### 2. 📄 `.gitignore`

* Tells Git which files/folders to ignore when pushing to a Git repository.
* Common ignores:

  * `node_modules/`
  * `.env`
  * `build/` or `dist/`

---

### 3. 📄 `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`

* Records the exact versions of installed packages.
* Ensures **consistent installs** across environments.

---

### 4. 📄 `README.md`

* Provides documentation for your project.
* Useful for others (or you) to understand the project later.

---

## 🗂️ Core Working Folders in React

### ✅ `src/`

All the React code lives here.

**Important files:**

* `index.js` or `main.jsx`
* `App.js` or `App.jsx`
* Additional components and logic

### ✅ `public/`

Contains static files served directly. Does not undergo bundling.

**Important files:**

#### 📝 `index.html`

* The **entry point** for the React app.
* Contains this important line:

  ```html
  <div id="root"></div>
  ```
* This is where React **injects** the app into the HTML.

> **Note**: You won't see any `<script>` manually added for your React code because the **bundler injects it** at runtime.

#### 📝 `manifest.json`

* Describes the **web app metadata**.
* Important for **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)**.

#### 📝 `robots.txt`

* Tells search engines **what to index** or not index from your site.

#### 📝 `<noscript>` tag

* Shown when **JavaScript is disabled** in the browser.
* Example:

  ```html
  <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript>
  ```

## 🧠 How React Injects into HTML (CRA & Vite)

### In CRA:

1. **`index.js`**

   * This is the JavaScript file that starts the app.
   * Injects `<App />` into `div#root` using `ReactDOM.createRoot`.

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

2. **React Scripts**

   * CRA uses a dependency called `react-scripts`.
   * Behind the scenes, it uses **Webpack** to inject the `index.js` into the `index.html`.

---

### In Vite:

1. No `react-scripts`. Vite uses **native ES modules** and is extremely fast.
2. Instead of `index.js`, Vite uses **`main.jsx`**.
3. In `index.html` (public folder), Vite manually injects JavaScript via:

   ```html
   <script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
   ```

**main.jsx**:

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

✅ **Summary**: In both CRA and Vite, the **React app is rendered inside the `#root` div** of `index.html`.

---

## 🧠 Virtual DOM & Real DOM

### What is DOM?

* DOM = Document Object Model (browser structure of HTML).

### React Virtual DOM

* A **virtual copy of the browser DOM**.
* React makes changes in Virtual DOM first.
* Then **compares it** with real DOM (called **diffing**).
* Only the **changed parts** are updated in real DOM = better performance.

---

## 📘 JSX (JavaScript XML)

* JSX is a **syntax extension** that allows writing HTML inside JavaScript.
* JSX is converted to `React.createElement()` behind the scenes.

```js
function App() {
  return <h1>Hello JSX</h1>;
}
```

### JSX Rules:

* Return only **one parent element**. If you need to return multiple, use:

  * A `<div>`
  * Or a **React Fragment** `<> ... </>`

---

## 💡 What is a Fragment in React?

A **Fragment** lets you group multiple elements **without adding extra nodes** to the DOM.

```jsx
<>
  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>World</p>
</>
```

* It helps to avoid unnecessary wrapper `<div>`s.
* Behind the scenes: `React.Fragment`.

---

## 🧪 What is React.StrictMode?

* A **tool for highlighting potential problems** in your React application during development.
* It **doesn't affect production**.
* Helps you:

  * Identify side effects
  * Detect deprecated methods
  * Double-invokes certain functions to test resilience

Removing it disables those checks.

---

## 🔁 What is `<App />`?

* A **React component**.
* A JavaScript function that returns **JSX**.

```js
function App() {
  return <h1>Hello React</h1>;
}
export default App;
```

> React lets you write "HTML in JS" = gives programming capabilities to HTML.

---

## 📂 Creating Component in Vite (`Chai.jsx`)

1. File must end with `.jsx` if you’re using JSX.
2. Component function name must start with **Capital letter**.
3. Only one parent element must be returned.

```jsx
function Chai() {
  return <h1>Chai Component</h1>;
}
export default Chai;
```

Then use in `App.jsx`:

```jsx
import Chai from './Chai';

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Chai />
      <h1>Chai aur React</h1>
    </>
  );
}
```

---

## ❓ Why Called Single Page Application (SPA)?

* In a SPA:

  * There is only **one HTML page** (usually `index.html`).
  * JavaScript controls **which components to show**.
  * Navigation between pages is **simulated using React Router**.
  * No full page reload; only parts of the page update.

SPA = Better speed, smoother user experience.

## 🟡 Summary of Key Differences (CRA vs Vite)

| Feature           | CRA                        | Vite                    |

| Bundler           | Webpack                    | Native ESBuild (faster) |
| Initial Load Time | Slower                     | Much Faster             |
| File Injection    | Hidden via `react-scripts` | Explicit via `main.jsx` |
| Config Files      | Hidden                     | Open for configuration  |
| Testing Libraries | Included                   | Not included by default |
| Customization     | Hard                       | Easy                    |

## ✅ Final Checklist for Components

* ✅ Component name starts with capital letter
* ✅ File name matches component name and ends with `.jsx`
* ✅ Only one JSX element is returned (use fragment if needed)
* ✅ Component is exported before use
