# Virtual DOM, Fibre, Hydration, and Reconciliation — Detailed Notes

---

## 1. Virtual DOM (VDOM)

* **Definition:**
  Virtual DOM is an **in-memory representation** of the actual DOM (Document Object Model). It acts as a lightweight copy of the real DOM.

* **Purpose:**
  The Virtual DOM allows efficient UI updates by reducing direct and costly manipulations on the real DOM, which are slow and performance-intensive.

* **How it works:**

  * When the app state changes, a **new Virtual DOM tree** is created to represent the updated UI.
  * A **diffing algorithm** compares this new Virtual DOM tree with the previous one to detect what exactly has changed.
  * Only the identified differences (or minimal changes) are then **applied to the real DOM**. This process avoids re-rendering the entire DOM and improves performance significantly.

* **Common Usage:**

  * Widely used in front-end libraries and frameworks such as **ReactJS** to optimize rendering.
  * Helps to maintain UI consistency while efficiently updating views.

* **Is Virtual DOM still used in React?**

  * **No**, React no longer uses the classic Virtual DOM approach directly since React 18 with the introduction of the **Fibre architecture**. (More details below)

## 2. `createRoot()` in React 18+

* **What is `createRoot()`?**

  * `createRoot()` is a new React API introduced with React 18 to initialize the root of the React application.
  * It creates a **DOM-like structure behind the scenes** using the new Fiber reconciler, enabling concurrent rendering capabilities.

* **Role in rendering:**

  * Instead of synchronously rendering the entire app and blocking the main thread, `createRoot()` supports **concurrent rendering**, allowing React to interrupt, pause, and resume rendering work efficiently.
  * This means smoother UI updates, better responsiveness, and improved user experience.

* **Effect on page loading:**

  * In traditional DOM rendering, **loading icons or spinners** are shown while the entire DOM paints on the browser.
  * With `createRoot()` and concurrent rendering, React can progressively render UI pieces, improving perceived loading time.

## 3. Fibre Architecture (React Fiber)

* **Definition:**
  Fibre is React's **reconciliation algorithm rewrite** implemented as a **Fiber tree**, enabling incremental rendering.

* **Why Fibre?**

  * The old reconciliation in React was synchronous and blocking, meaning React would work on the entire update at once, which could cause UI jank for large applications.
  * Fibre breaks work into smaller units, allowing React to pause, yield, and resume work without blocking the main thread.

* **How it works:**

  * Fibre keeps track of **units of work** in a tree structure (Fiber tree).
  * It allows prioritizing updates, handling animations, gestures, and other high-priority tasks without delaying the UI.

* **Benefits:**

  * Enables **Concurrent Mode** (React 18+) for better user experience.
  * Improves rendering efficiency and responsiveness.

## 4. Hydration

* **Definition:**
  Hydration is the process of **attaching event listeners and making a server-rendered static HTML page interactive on the client side**.

* **Context:**

  * Used in frameworks that support **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** such as React, Next.js, Vue, etc.
  * The server sends fully rendered HTML to the client for faster initial load and SEO benefits.

* **How hydration works:**

  * After the static HTML is loaded and visible in the browser, JavaScript takes control and **hydrates** the DOM.
  * It attaches event handlers and initializes React components so the page behaves like a dynamic SPA (Single Page Application).

* **Benefits:**

  * Faster perceived load times (users see content quickly).
  * Full interactivity without a full re-render from scratch.

## 5. Reconciliation

* **Definition:**
  Reconciliation is React's process of **updating the DOM** by comparing the **new Virtual DOM** with the **previous Virtual DOM**.

* **How reconciliation works:**

  * Uses a **diffing algorithm** to detect changes between renders efficiently.
  * Determines what parts of the UI need updating (insertions, deletions, moves, or updates).
  * Applies **only the minimal required changes** to the real DOM to keep it in sync with the application state.

* **Why it’s important:**

  * Minimizes expensive DOM operations, improving app performance.
  * Ensures UI consistency and smooth user experiences.
