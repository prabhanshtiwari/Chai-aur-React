# Interview Questions

### 1.  What is React?
- React is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Meta (formerly Facebook) for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications (SPAs).
- It allows developers to create reusable UI components that manage their own state, making code more modular, predictable, and maintainable.

### 2. What is an SPA (Single Page Application)?
- An **SPA (Single Page Application)** is a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content without reloading the entire page.
- Instead of fetching a new page from the server on every user interaction, an SPA uses JavaScript (usually with libraries like React, Angular, or Vue) to update the view dynamically, which makes the application faster and more responsive.
